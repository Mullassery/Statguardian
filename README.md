## The Problem: Silent Data Quality Failures

**Data pipelines fail silently every day:**

```
Pipeline produces: 
├─ Wrong schema (7 columns instead of 8)
├─ Null values in required fields (payment_id is NULL)
├─ Out-of-range values (temperature = 99,999°C)
├─ Statistical drift (mean increased by 40% overnight)
├─ Duplicates (same transaction ID appears 5 times)
└─ Anomalies (one customer spent $1B in a day)

Your data warehouse: "All good! ✅"
Business dashboard: "Why are our KPIs nonsense?"
Engineering: "We didn't even know there was a problem 😱"
```

### Why This Happens

**Current approach:**
1. Hope your SQL looks right
2. Trust pandas doesn't silently drop data
3. Pray your ETL doesn't have subtle bugs
4. Discover problems in production (hours/days later)
5. Spend days debugging "what went wrong"

**The cost:**
- Bad decisions based on corrupted data
- Cascading failures downstream (analytics, ML models)
- Lost revenue while debugging
- Brand damage if customers see errors
- Manual data quality checks (labor-intensive, error-prone)

---

## The Solution: StatGuardian

**Define your data contract once. Detect all quality issues automatically.**

```python
# StatGuardian catches problems BEFORE they propagate

import statguardian

# 1. Define contract (human-readable, self-documenting)
contract = statguardian.DataContract.from_file("orders.sg")

# 2. Validate (any format: Parquet, CSV, JSON, Avro, Delta, Iceberg)
report = statguardian.execute_file(contract, "orders.parquet")

# 3. Get instant feedback
if report.passed:
    print("✅ Data quality: PASS")
    print(f"  Completeness: {report.completeness:.2%}")
    print(f"  Schema match: {report.schema_match:.2%}")
    print(f"  Statistical drift: OK (< 15%)")
else:
    print("❌ Data quality: FAIL")
    for issue in report.issues:
        print(f"  CRITICAL: {issue.severity} - {issue.message}")
        print(f"    Rows affected: {issue.affected_rows}")
        print(f"    Recommendation: {issue.remediation}")
```

### Real Issues StatGuardian Catches

| Issue Type | Example | Caught By StatGuardian? |
|---|---|---|
| Schema mismatch | 7 columns instead of 8 | ✅ Yes |
| Missing required field | order_id is NULL | ✅ Yes |
| Invalid enum | status = "pending_" (typo) | ✅ Yes |
| Out-of-range values | price = -$50 | ✅ Yes |
| Duplicates | Same order_id twice | ✅ Yes |
| Statistical drift | Price mean +40% overnight | ✅ Yes |
| Outliers | $1B transaction from $10 avg customer | ✅ Yes |
| Schema type mismatches | customer_id stored as float instead of string | ✅ Yes |
| Data encoding issues | Unicode characters in ASCII field | ✅ Yes |

## How It Works

### Step 1: Write a Contract (Once)

```
# orders.sg - Your data quality contract
dataset orders {
    schema {
        order_id:     string, not_null, unique, primary_key
        customer_id:  string, not_null
        amount:       float,  positive, max=100000.0
        currency:     string, not_null, enum=["USD","EUR","GBP","JPY"]
        status:       string, not_null, enum=["pending","paid","cancelled","refunded"]
        created_at:   date,   not_null
    }

    quality {
        @blocking: completeness(order_id) > 0.9999
        @blocking: uniqueness(order_id) == 1.0
        @warning:  completeness(customer_id) > 0.99
    }

    stats {
        amount.mean drift < 0.15        # Mean shouldn't change >15%
        amount.p95 drift < 0.25          # P95 shouldn't change >25%
        status distribution stable       # Distribution shouldn't change
    }

    anomalies {
        detect_outliers(amount, method="iqr")  # Catch extreme values
        detect_duplicates(order_id)             # Catch duplicates
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Validate (Any Format)

```python
import statguardian
import polars as pl

contract = statguardian.DataContract.from_file("orders.sg")

# Works with ANY format (auto-detected):
report = statguardian.execute_file(contract, "orders.parquet")
report = statguardian.execute_file(contract, "orders.csv")
report = statguardian.execute_file(contract, "orders.json")

# Or from a DataFrame:
df = pl.read_parquet("orders.parquet")
report = statguardian.execute_dataframe(contract, df)

# Or from a table (auto-connects):
report = statguardian.execute_table(
    contract,
    table="my_dataset.orders",
    warehouse="snowflake"  # or "bigquery", "redshift", etc.
)
```

### Step 3: Get Actionable Feedback

```python
# Detailed report
if not report.passed:
    for issue in report.issues:
        print(f"{issue.severity}: {issue.field} - {issue.message}")
        print(f"  Affected rows: {issue.affected_rows:,}")
        print(f"  Action: {issue.remediation}")

# Metrics
print(f"Completeness: {report.completeness:.2%}")
print(f"Validity: {report.validity:.2%}")
print(f"Consistency: {report.consistency:.2%}")

# Drift detection
print(f"Statistical drift: {report.drift_score:.2%}")
if report.has_drift:
    for field, drift in report.field_drifts.items():
        print(f"  {field}: {drift.change:.1%} change")
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: E-Commerce

**Problem:** Orders table silently started recording prices as 10x too high (data entry bug at source)

**Traditional approach:**
- Dashboard shows 10x revenue overnight
- Business makes decisions based on fake data
- Bug discovered 3 days later (after decisions made)
- Damage: $2M in wrong resource allocation

**With StatGuardian:**
```
❌ FAIL: amount drift detected (1000% change)
  Previous mean: $50.00
  Current mean: $500.00
  Variance increase: 10000%
  Action: BLOCKING - investigate before pipeline continues
```
Bug caught in seconds, not days.

### Example 2: ML Pipeline

**Problem:** User table's age field sometimes stored as NULL, sometimes as -1

**Traditional:** ML model training silently drops 5% of records, reduces accuracy
**With StatGuardian:**
```
❌ FAIL: Schema violation
  Field: age
  Issue: NULL values in NOT_NULL field (5% of records)
  Action: Blocked pipeline before ML training
```

### Example 3: Analytics

**Problem:** Customer lifetime value calculation using wrong currency (confused USD and EUR)

**Traditional:** Dashboard shows 100x higher revenue for EU customers (silently wrong for weeks)
**With StatGuardian:**
```
❌ FAIL: Statistical anomaly detected
  Field: currency
  Issue: Unexpected values detected: "EUR" in USD-only records
  Affected: 8,500 rows
  Action: BLOCKING - requires manual review
```

## Contract Language Features

### Schema Validation

```
schema {
    # Basic types
    id:         string, not_null, unique
    age:        int, min=0, max=150
    price:      float, positive
    flag:       boolean
    
    # Enums
    status:     string, enum=["active", "inactive", "pending"]
    country:    string, enum=["US", "UK", "CA", "AU"]
    
    # Temporal
    created_at: date, not_null
    updated_at: timestamp
    
    # Complex
    tags:       array<string>
    metadata:   struct<key: string, value: string>
}
```

### Quality Rules

```
quality {
    # Basic completeness
    @blocking: completeness(id) == 1.0
    @warning:  completeness(email) > 0.95
    
    # Uniqueness
    @blocking: uniqueness(order_id) == 1.0
    
    # Custom SQL-like conditions
    @blocking: count(id) > 0  # At least 1 row
    @warning:  stddev(amount) < 1000  # Values not too spread
    
    # Domain-specific
    @blocking: sum(refunds) <= sum(purchases)  # Refunds ≤ purchases
}
```

### Statistical Validation

```
stats {
    # Drift detection (compared to baseline)
    amount.mean drift < 0.15      # Mean shouldn't change >15%
    amount.p95 drift < 0.25       # P95 shouldn't change >25%
    age.stddev drift < 0.10       # Variance shouldn't change >10%
    
    # Distribution stability
    status distribution stable    # Relative proportions unchanged
    country distribution stable
}
```

### Anomaly Detection

```
anomalies {
    detect_outliers(amount, method="iqr")           # IQR method
    detect_outliers(price, method="zscore", std=5)  # Z-score >5σ
    detect_duplicates(order_id)                     # Exact duplicates
    detect_skew(age, method="pearson")              # Distribution shape
}
```

    Validate multiple Excel / Parquet / CSV / … files against one contract.

    Files are processed concurrently using a thread pool.  The GIL is
    released during the Rust validation call, so true parallelism is
    achieved for CPU-bound checks on multi-core machines.

    Args:
        contract:       DataContract compiled with ``statguard.DataContract.from_file()``.
        paths:          Glob pattern (e.g. ``"data/2026/**/*.parquet"``) or list of paths.
        workers:        Thread pool size. Defaults to ``min(32, cpu_count + 4)``.
        reference_path: Optional reference file for drift detection (applied to all files).
        on_complete:    Optional callback called with each ``FileResult`` as it completes.

    Returns:
        List of ``FileResult`` objects, in completion order (not input order).

    Example::

        contract = statguard.DataContract.from_file("orders.sg")
        results = statguard.execute_files(contract, "data/orders_*.parquet")

        failed = [r for r in results if r.failed]

    Like ``execute_files`` but yields each ``FileResult`` as it completes.
